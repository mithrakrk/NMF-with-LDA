<h3>Things to Keep in mind:</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Since Stack Exchange's Data Explorer API in python has a limit for downloads set at 8,000 rows, all parts of code will adhere to that</li>
  <li> I'm using only <a href="http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-13657-3_43">"Arun's Metric"</a> to decide on how many topics will give most accurate Modeling</li>
  <li> <a href="https://pypi.org/project/lda/">LDA model</a> used is from PyPI, and uses Collapsed Gibbs Sampling </li>
  <li> Following are links with some useful explaination of LDA and Gibbs:
